# Financial Risk Analysis for Loan Approval

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze financial risk and predict loan approval outcomes.  
The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Loan application and financial data  
- **Objective**: Predict loan approval status based on applicant information  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature encoding and scaling  
  - Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, etc.)  
  - Model evaluation using Accuracy and F1 Score  

## Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance with multiple models  
- Random Forest gave the highest accuracy and F1 score  

## Files
- `Financial_Risk_Analysis_For_Loan_Approval.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with full code and analysis
 

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
